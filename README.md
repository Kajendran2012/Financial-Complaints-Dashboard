📊 Financial Complaints Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and monitor financial customer complaints. The dashboard provides key insights into complaint trends, resolution efficiency, dispute rates, and product- or region-level problem areas to support data-driven decision-making.

Financial institutions handle a large volume of customer complaints, and understanding these complaints is critical for improving customer service, regulatory compliance, and operational performance.

🎯 Business Objective

Track complaint volumes and trends

Measure responsiveness and resolution performance

Identify high-risk products, issues, and regions

Improve customer satisfaction and compliance outcomes

📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
